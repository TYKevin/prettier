#### Fix(Markdown): inserts newline in lists containing codeblock but skips last element(#17731) (#17760 by @TYKevin)

Minor refactor to derive Markdown list looseness from the ancestor list’s spread property in the AST, instead of relying on a trailing newline character.

Additionally, this PR consolidates and mirrors logic from #17675 and #16637 into `isLooseListItem`, since all are used to determine list looseness.
